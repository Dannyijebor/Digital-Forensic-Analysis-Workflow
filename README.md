# **Digital Forensic Analysis Workflow**

## **Repository Name:** `Digital-Forensic-Analysis`

### **Overview**  
This repository provides a **structured digital forensic analysis framework** based on industry best practices. Using the methodology in the image, it outlines **forensic duplication, data preparation, and forensic analysis techniques** to help cybersecurity professionals investigate security breaches, malware incidents, and insider threats.

---

### **Scenario: Investigating a Data Breach in an Enterprise Network**
#### **Problem Statement**
A **financial institution** experiences **a data breach**, where customer records are suspected to be **exfiltrated** from the database. The IT security team detects **anomalous database queries and unusual access logs** on the server. The forensic team is tasked with investigating the breach and identifying the perpetrator.

### **Forensic Analysis Process Using the Framework**
#### **1️⃣ Perform Forensic Duplication**
✔ **Create a forensic copy of all evidence media** (e.g., hard drives, memory dumps, and logs).  
✔ Use **write-blockers** to prevent tampering with original data.  
✔ Generate **hash values (MD5, SHA-256)** to ensure data integrity.  

#### **2️⃣ Prepare Data for Analysis**
✔ **Create a working copy** of forensic images to preserve original evidence.  
✔ Generate **file system and partition table statistics** to understand the disk structure.  
✔ **Recover deleted files and unallocated space** for hidden or previously erased data.  
✔ Perform **file signature analysis** to detect modified or disguised files.  
✔ **Identify known system files** to filter out legitimate system activity.  

#### **3️⃣ Analyze Extracted Data**
✔ **Extract emails and attachments** to identify suspicious communications.  
✔ **Review browser history files** to check for access to unauthorized or malicious sites.  
✔ **Examine installed applications** to detect unauthorized or malicious programs.  
✔ **Search for relevant strings** (e.g., keywords related to data exfiltration, hacking tools, or suspicious user activity).  
✔ **Review network-based evidence**, such as firewall logs and connection records.  

#### **4️⃣ Perform Advanced Analysis**
✔ Conduct **software analysis** to examine suspicious executable files.  
✔ **Decrypt encrypted files** if data obfuscation is detected.  
✔ Perform a **file-by-file review** to detect manipulated or unauthorized modifications.  
✔ Carry out **specialized forensic analysis**, such as steganography detection or memory forensics.
